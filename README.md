University ranking are a bragging right to showcase the strength and growth of a university. This study seeks to answer the following questions:

What type of university is mostly ranked and why?

What is the impact of university size on their ranking?

What is the important of academic research for a university?

Which region has the highest number of universities on the rank?

To answer these questions, I analyzed the latest QS world ranking dataset from Kaggle. It covers a 6 years period between 2017 and 2022. I used Python programming and Jupyter notebook to complete this project.

The QS World University Rankings is a yearly ranking of universities around the world by Quacquarelli Symonds. The QS ranking receives approval from the International Ranking Expert Group (IREG) and it is one of the most acceptable universities ranking in the world. The QS World University Rankings methodology has been designed to be accessible, globally relevant, and stable.  QS originally began the process of ranking universities internationally by identifying the primary objectives of world class universities: research quality, graduate employability, teaching experience and international outlook. It then sought ways of measuring each of these. The QS methodology has six indicators looking at four broad categories: research reputation, the learning and teaching environment, research impact, and internationalization.
